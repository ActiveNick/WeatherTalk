# WeatherTalk
Windows 10 / UWP sample weather app written in C# for phones, tablets, desktops, IoT devices, Xbox & HoloLens. This project is used as a demo for various presentations on building UWP apps for Windows 10, as well as integrating speech and Azure in apps.

## Current Features
The app supports the following features:

- Pull weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.org
- Simple adaptive UI across various Windows 10 form factors & screens
- Text-to-speech support to speak the forecast out loud using the default system voice
- Save cities being queried in an Azure Mobile Service table
- Launch the app via Voice Commands from the Cortana canvas (VCD)
- Deep-linking from external apps to trigger weather searches & speech synthesis

## Upcoming Features
This is my tentative to do list in terms of where I want to take this sample:
- Migrate the Azure backend to App Services
- Add support for ambient temperature readings from external sensors on Windows 10 IoT Core
- Add a weather map with Bing Maps
- Add a hamburger menu for additional commands
- Migrate the app architecture to MVVM
- Extend the adaptive UI design
- Adding app analytics via HockeyApp
